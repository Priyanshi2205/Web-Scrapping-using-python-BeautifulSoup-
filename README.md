# Web-Scrapping-using-python-BeautifulSoup-
Data scraping is the first step in any data analytics project. It involves pulling data (usually from the web) and compiling it into a usable format. While thereâ€™s no shortage of great data repositories available online, scraping and cleaning data yourself is a great way to show off your skills.

In this project I have scrapped the movies data from the Imdb website of first 1000 best movies using python.
BeautifulSoup is the main library that is used to extract the data from a website.

**URL of the Website :** https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?count=100&groups=top_1000&sort=user_rating

**Steps to be carried out**
1. Import all the neccesary library 
2. Find the URL that you want to scrape.
3. Inspecting the Page.
4. Find the data you want to extract.
5. Write the code.
6. Run the code and extract the data.
7. Store the data in the required format.


**#Note:** I have done it for single page, for extracting data from the multiple pages put the code in the for loop.
